# Employee Retention Model Comparison


## Overview

This project evaluates and compares the performance of various machine learning models for predicting employee retention. The models assessed include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to determine which model provides the best balance of accuracy, generalization, and interpretability for the given task.

## Model Performance Summary

### 1. Logistic Regression
- **Cross-Validation F1 Scores:** [0.9677, 0.9714, 0.9697, 1.0000, 0.9677]
- **Mean Cross-Validation F1 Score:** 0.975
- **Test F1 Score:** 0.951

### 2. Random Forest
- **Cross-Validation F1 Scores:** [0.9677, 0.9697, 0.9697, 1.0000, 1.0000]
- **Mean Cross-Validation F1 Score:** 0.981
- **Test F1 Score:** 0.935

### 3. Gradient Boosting
- **Cross-Validation F1 Scores:** [0.9677, 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000]
- **Mean Cross-Validation F1 Score:** 0.994
- **Test F1 Score:** 0.935

### 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Cross-Validation F1 Scores:** [0.9677, 0.9412, 0.9697, 1.0000, 0.8966]
- **Mean Cross-Validation F1 Score:** 0.955
- **Test F1 Score:** 0.918

## Model Comparison

1. **Gradient Boosting**:
   - Best cross-validation performance with a mean F1 score of 0.994.
   - Achieved perfect scores in 4 out of 5 folds, indicating high consistency.
   - Slightly lower test F1 score of 0.935 suggests potential overfitting.

2. **Random Forest**:
   - Second-best in cross-validation with a mean F1 score of 0.981.
   - Matches Gradient Boosting's test F1 score of 0.935.

3. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Strong performance with a mean cross-validation F1 score of 0.975.
   - Highest test F1 score of 0.951, indicating excellent generalization to unseen data.

4. **SVM**:
   - Lowest performance among the models with a mean cross-validation F1 score of 0.955 and a test F1 score of 0.918.
   - Shows higher variability in cross-validation scores, indicating less stability.

## Conclusion

All models demonstrate strong performance with F1 scores consistently above 0.90, highlighting the informativeness of the features for predicting employee retention.

- **Gradient Boosting** excels in cross-validation, capturing complex patterns effectively but requires careful tuning to avoid overfitting.
- **Logistic Regression** offers the best generalization to the test set and is simpler, making it a strong candidate for deployment.
- **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** should be further explored to understand feature importance and potential improvements.
- **SVM** shows less stability and lower performance, suggesting it may not be as suitable for this task.

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy the Logistic Regression model** due to its strong test performance and interpretability.
2. **Investigate the Gradient Boosting model** to understand its high cross-validation performance and lower test performance, possibly through learning curve analysis or regularization adjustments.
3. **Analyze feature importance** in the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models to gain insights into key factors influencing employee retention.
4. **Consider ensemble methods** that combine strengths of multiple models, such as a weighted average of Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting predictions.
5. **Regularly update and evaluate models** with new data to ensure continued relevance and performance.

These findings provide a solid foundation for improving employee retention strategies and enhancing overall workforce management. 
By leveraging the insights from the model comparisons, organizations can better understand the factors influencing employee retention and make informed decisions to optimize their retention strategies. 
Implementing the recommended models and approaches can help any company in developing more effective and tailored strategies for managing their workforce.
